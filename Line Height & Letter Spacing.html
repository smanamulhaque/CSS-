<p>  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that can perform
     tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning,
     reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and recognizing patterns. 
     AI is widely used in everyday life, such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems,
     medical diagnosis, and autonomous vehicles. It helps businesses improve efficiency,
     reduce errors, and make smarter decisions. Machine learning, a major part of AI, 
     allows systems to learn from data and improve over time. As AI continues to advance,
     it is transforming industries and creating new opportunities, 
     making it one of the most important technologies of the modern world.</p>
